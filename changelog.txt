18/1/17 - Version 3.1
- Ignore empty Other folders.


4/1/17 - Version 3.0
- Id-less. Automatic replacing of the team IDs in the exports' files.
- Support for PES17's portraits.


29/11/16 - Version 2.0
- A fuckload of fixes. Now everything should work properly, including the bins file creation,
the zlibbing and the checking of exports.
- Soon(tm): Checking the texture filenames inside the kit config files.


13/11/16 - Version 1.3
- Modified the export extracting part of the script to warn about the amount of kit entries
in the txt not being the same as the amount of kit config files in the export.
- Improved the unicolor bin compiler to support txt files which don't have an Other section,
and to show on screen the number of team colors and kits that were recognized properly.


27/10/16 - Version 1.2
- Removed the option for offering to create a txt for teams without note txts (it was breaking
the whole program every time it was activated).
- Improved the recognition of teams with txts without a team ID.
- Added warning about txts with unicode formatting being unsupported.
- Added support for teams with more than 7 kits to the unicolor bin updater.


26/10/16 - Version 1.1
- Implemented the removal of Thumbs.db files by making 7zip exclude them while extracting exports.
- Added support to the checker for edithair faces.
- Improved the zlibbing function by making it store every texture it zlibs in a folder, so that
there's no need to zlib everything again when rerunning the script.
- Added an option to make the cpkmaker exe compress the cpk it makes instead of zlibbing every
texture. The zlibbing method is still recommended if compression is needed, though.


25/10/16 - Version 1
- Initial support for the new simplified export format.
