:: 4cc aet compiler - Settings file
:: 
:: Lines starting with :: are comment lines and will be ignored by the script.
:: 1 means enabled, 0 means disabled. No spaces allowed next to the equal sign.
:: 
::
:: - Cpk Name -
:: Write the package names you want without quotes (e.g. 4cc, vg lel)
:: The maximum name length you can set here is 28 characters. Spaces are fine.
set cpk_name=4cc_80_test
:: 
:: 
:: - Move Cpks -
:: This setting is for enabling the moving of the cpks to PES' download folder after
:: they have been created. If disabled the cpks will stay in the script's folder.
:: Default: 1
set move_cpks=1
:: 
:: 
:: - PES' Download Folder Path -
:: Set the path to PES' download folder (Only used if move_cpks is enabled).
set pes_download_folder_location="C:\Program Files (x86)\Pro Evolution Soccer 2016\download"
:: 
:: 
:: - DpFileList Updating -
:: If enabled, the DpFileList file in your PES' download folder will be automatically
:: updated with the entries needed for PES to load the cpks the script just created.
:: Although the script does check if updating is needed before doing it, the process
:: as a whole is a bit slow, so if you're sure you're not going to need it you can
:: disable it from here.
:: (If move_cpks is disabled, the DpFileList file won't be modified in any case.)
:: Default: 1
set dpfl_updating=1
:: 
:: 
:: - Pause when Wrong -
:: This setting is for pausing the script every time an export with wrong folders is found.
:: Even if disabled, a line with the team's name is added to the memelist.txt file, so that
:: you can meme on its manager (and fix the problem). Also, the export will be discarded.
:: With this setting you can stop the script and fix the export before restarting it.
:: Disable it if you want to leave your pc running unattended without ever stopping.
:: Default: 1
set pause_when_wrong=1
:: 
:: 
:: - Bins Updating -
:: This setting is usually only needed by aesthetics helpers.
:: If enabled, the UniColor and TeamColor files in the other_stuff folder will be automatically
:: updated with entries taken from the teams' txt files. These files will then be copied to the
:: patches_contents folder and end up in the final patch.
:: Default: 1
set bins_updating=1
:: 
:: 
:: - Compression Level -
:: This setting is usually only needed by aesthetics helpers.
:: . Level 0 means no compression, the largest cpk size and fastest compilation speed.
:: . Level 1 enables compression during the final packing, which becomes slower, and results
:: in cpks which are around half as large as the uncompressed ones.
:: . Level 2 is the highest level and makes the script check for unzlibbed textures and zlib
:: them individually during the extraction of the exports, after checking them. This method
:: is the slowest one the first time the script is run, but it results in cpks which are
:: around a third of the size of the uncompressed ones.
:: To mitigate level 2's slowness, a copy of every texture that has been zlibbed is kept in the
:: storage_zlibbed folder, and when running the script again only new textures are zlibbed.
:: This means that new textures with the same name as old ones will get replaced with an
:: old copy though, so deleting the export folders of previously compiled exports from the
:: storage_zlibbed folder when compiling new versions is required when using this setting.
:: . In short, use level 1 if you just want a simple compression, and use level 2 if you know
:: exactly what you're doing.
:: Default: 0
set compression=0
:: 
:: 
:: - Dual Cpk Mode -
:: This setting is usually only needed by aesthetics helpers.
:: Dual cpk mode creates a two cpks, one with the face files and another one with the kits, boots,
:: gloves, logos and other stuff.
:: You can set their names here (The previous name will be ignored)
set dualcpk_mode=0
set faces_cpk_name=4cc_70_testfaces
set uniform_cpk_name=4cc_75_testuniform
:: 
:: 
:: - Full Patch Mode -
:: This setting is usually only needed by aesthetics helpers.
:: Full patch mode creates a _uniform cpk which includes all the default bin files and the 
:: boots, gloves, thumbnails and other stuff, needed for it to completely replace the default
:: 4cc_uniform cpk. It also copies the bin files again from the other_stuff folder.
:: This mode requires the default_contents folder to be present in the script's folder.
:: Default: 0
set full_patch=0
:: 
:: 
:: - Pass-through Mode -
:: If enabled, exports will never be discarded even if errors are recognized.
:: The script will still warn about errors and say the export has been discarded.
:: Use it if the script ever recognizes some errors in your export but the export is
:: actually fine. If errors are actually present, though, conflicts may happen.
:: Hopefully this setting will be never needed.
:: Default: 0
set pass_through=0
:: 
:: 
:: - Forced Admin Mode -
:: [Important] This setting is for forcing the request of admin permissions.
:: The script checks automatically if you need admin permissions or not depending on your
:: pes install folder, but if despite that the script fails to move the cpks enable this.
:: (If move_cpks is disabled, admin permissions won't be asked in any case.)
:: Default: 0
set admin_mode=0
